🧰 Legacy Utils
A collection of legacy tools, helper scripts, and experimental utilities from earlier projects.
These were built to solve specific problems, test concepts, or automate repetitive tasks.
While not actively maintained, they are archived here for reference and historical continuity.

🔍 Contents
This repository may include:

Small Python scripts for quick testing or automation

Bash/Powershell one-liners and utility functions

Proof-of-concept tools or unfinished prototypes

Deprecated or replaced versions of tools from other repos

📦 Why Archive?
These scripts still hold value as learning references or utility snippets, but have been moved out of active rotation to keep my main repositories clean and focused. Consider them snapshots of previous workflows and development style.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Code in this repository is provided as-is. Many scripts may lack polish, error handling, or complete documentation. Use at your own discretion.
